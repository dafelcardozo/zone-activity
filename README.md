My Frontend Developer test exam for Rokk3rlabs.

Please check it out at this URL: http://ec2-54-164-66-21.compute-1.amazonaws.com/

Or if you prefer, you can clone this repository and than open the file index.html with your favorite browser.

Those are the technologies which I used for building this project:

- the Atom.io editor
- AngularJS 1.5.x
- Bootstrap 3.x
- Bower for dependencies downloading
- Gulp as a script concatenator / minifier.
- Charts.js for the very beautiful charts.
- angular-charts for the integration of those with Angular.
- jQuery for a few things
- HTML 5 and CSS 3.

Thanks and credits to all of those tools !

And a very special thanks to Rokk3rlabs for considering me.
