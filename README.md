This is a sample tech evaluation repo for a few of the technologies I've been working on in the last few months.

You can clone this repository and than open the file index.html with your favorite browser.

Those are the technologies which I used for building this project:

- the Atom.io editor
- AngularJS 1.5.x
- Bootstrap 3.x
- Bower for dependencies downloading
- Gulp as a script concatenator / minifier.
- Charts.js for the very beautiful charts.
- angular-charts for the integration of those with Angular.
- jQuery for a few things
- HTML 5 and CSS 3.

Thanks and credits to all of those tools !
